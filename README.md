# The Radix Programmer's Guild (aka RPG)

RPG is a member-driven full-service development shop that builds Dapps, tools and blueprints for the Radix protocol.

The Guild also provides services including product design reviews, user testing, documentation and audits.

The Guild will operate in a DAO-like manner under a small benevolent leadership team until it officially reorganizes as a DAO running on the Radix protocol sometime after the Babylon release.

Our organizational documents are coming soon to Github pages at https://www.radguild.org and include:
  - Introduction
  - Manifesto
  - Rules
  - Roadmap
  - Membership

## Launching soon

Our blog is ready for our official launch announcement which is coming soon.

Our discord is almost ready.

Initial projects have been identified. 

The Guild is dedicated to improving our members' skills including discounts to forthcoming Rust and Scrypto Training resources as well as access to a discord community that is dedicated to Scrypto and Rust for cryptocurrency development.
