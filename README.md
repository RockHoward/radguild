# The Radix Programmer's Guild (aka RPG)

RPG is a member-directed community of designers and developers who are building the future of the world's financial services using the Radix protocol.

RPG operates as a full-service development shop that builds blueprints, tools and Dapps for the Radix protocol and provides services including product design reviews, user testing, documentation and audits. Contact the Guild to find out how we can help your project succeed!

The Guild operates in a DAO-like manner under a small benevolent leadership team until, sometime after the Babylon release, it officially reorganizes as a DAO running on the Radix protocol.

Our organizational documents are coming soon to Github pages at https://www.radguild.org and include:
  - Introduction
  - Manifesto
  - Rules
  - Roadmap
  - Membership

## Launching soon
