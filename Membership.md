## RadGuild Membership

All RadGuild members in good standing get:

- **Free access** to [**Rust & Scrypto Forum**](https://discord.gg/VSGu5mddse).

### Quarterly Tributes

Membership requires a tribute of $25 (or equivalent) per quarter starting in Q1, 2022.

- Members paying their tribute in USD will use a TBD online payment processor.

- XRD payment is another option. The amount of XRD required is updated weekly.

- Members with a large enough claim on the RadGuild Treasury may deduct their tribute from their claim.

- Tributes are due during the first month of each quarter.

### NFTs

RadGuild intends to issue NFTs to members who achieve advanced ranks. Details are TBD.

### Getting an Invitation

You can get an invite to visit the RadGuild discord by:

- writing an impressive introduction outlining your relevant skills in the Scrypto Forum above; or

- engaging with the learning materials in the Scrypto Forum and demonstrating that you are ready for a real project; or

- having a member in good standing of RadGuild recommend you.

### Our Recruitment Process

While RadGuild is mainly about supporting developers, we also need graphic designers, project managers,
project designers, sales people and such as well. If you think that you can help us succeed and, like
most RadGuild members, only have some part time hours available, we would like to hear from you.

Or "invite only" membership approach is probably temporary. With time and growth you can expect the Guild
to start putting out specific calls for people with specific skills just like a normal software firm.
Right now it is too hard to predict what we might need and so we are taking on a variety of people who
are attracted to the Guild concept but are preferably already somewhat beyond the rank beginner stage.
