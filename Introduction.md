## Introduction

**RadGuild** is a member-directed community of designers and developers who are building the future of the world's financial services using the Radix protocol.

RadGuild operates as a full-service development shop that builds blueprints, tools and Dapps for the Radix protocol and provides services including product design reviews, user testing, documentation and audits. Contact the Guild to find out how we can help your project succeed!

The Guild operates in a DAO-like manner under a small benevolent leadership team. Sometime soon after the Babylon release, it will officially reorganize as a DAO (Distributed Autonomious Organization) running on the Radix platform. At that time the Guild Members will directly decide all matters relating to the operation of the Guild.

The concept for a Programmer's Guild came from the August 2020 Radix whitepaper however, other than providing that brief reference, no one from the Radix team has been involved with the setup or organization of this group. Having said that, we are working hard to prove out our concept and win financial support from the Radix Ecosystem Holdings Ltd. and/or other venture investors with an interest in kickstarting project development for the Radix protocol.
