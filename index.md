## The Radix Programmer's Guild

**RadGuild** is a member-directed community of designers and developers who are building core software building blocks (aka blueprints) and key distributed applications (aka Dapps) for the [**Radix Decentralized Ledger**](https://radixdlt.com) which we believe will emerge as the key enabling technology for the free world's digital economy.
